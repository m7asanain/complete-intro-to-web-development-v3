      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Mustafa Hasanain. I am resident in Istabul, Turkey and live here with my family and my dog.</p>
      <p>Currently I work at Google as product manager of developer tools. Before I worked at Microsoft, LinkedIn ,
        Netflix, Reddit and other small companies.</p>
      <p>Here are some interesting accomplishments about me</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I once won a gaming tournament when I was six. We played Sonic & Knuckles.</li>
        <li>I ate burritos with the band Sugarcult. I don't even like Sugarcult. The burritos are the highlight of this
          story.</li>
        <li>I am one of the very few people to never graduate college nor ever take the standardized test GMAT and yet
          still be accepted into a master's program.</li>
      </ul>
